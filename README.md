This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Created with Nextjs 14

The app uses Docker so the app can be started by this command: 

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 valeremovies
```

Otherwise you can start the app by:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
